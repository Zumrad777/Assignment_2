This is assignment 2(MyArrayList and LinkedList)  I made for my Algorithms and Data Structures class.  
The goal was to implement basic data structures using java language.

 What I Implemented

- `MyArrayList<T>` – it is java class, resizable array (like `ArrayList`)
- `MyLinkedList<T>` – it is java class, simple linked list
- `MyStack<T>` – it is java class,stack using linked list (Last In First Out(LIFO))
- `MyQueue<T>` –it is java class, queue using linked list (First In First Out(FIFO))
- `MyMinHeap<T>` –it is java class, min-heap based on array
- Mylist = it is interface, defines the common methods implemented by the list classes (`MyArrayList`, `MyLinkedList`).

All classes use generics and are written in plain Java.
